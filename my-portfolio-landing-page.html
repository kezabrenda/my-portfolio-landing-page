                <p>
                    I am a highschool graduate, I finished highschool in the year 2019 in the combination of Mathematics, Computer Science and Economics(MCE).
                    Now I am currently attending the WeCode Program cohort 3 as of the year 2020.

            <h3 class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--about">why did you decided to take a class on programming?</h3>
                <p>
                    I decided to take a class on programming because for a long time now I had this kinda like an itch that I had to have some programming skills and if God willing, also make it a career.
                    And so when I finished highschool, I promised myself to find somewhere to keep that promise. When a friend of mine sent me a link for the WeCode program, I was more than excited and even though at some point during the application process I became a nervous wreck but I knew I had to try than regret later.
                    Anyway, I finally got accepted in the program and through the challenges and new experiences that come my way, I am more than willing to face them just to make that dream come true.
                    And maybe I may be fortunate enough to leave as big shoes to fill as <stong>Lady Ada Byron Lovelace</stong>, the woman who started it all.
                </p>

                    Needless to say I am quite odd, but I am proud of it. Between being extra plus size, 
                    eye glasses and my strange interests/hobbies/skills, there is no surprise to why my friends may refer to me as the perfect definition of "fat nerd" (love them really)
                    or in other words black <strong>Penelope Garcia</strong> (tech wiz starring in "criminal minds", love her!) 
                    but here are some:

                       but it is thanks to this WeCode that I was able to do even that much.
